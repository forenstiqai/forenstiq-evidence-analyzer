# All Modules Now Working - Fix Complete! ✅

## 🔧 Problem Fixed

**Before**: Clicking on "Storage Media", "Computers", "Network Equipment", or "Fraud Equipment" showed:
```
❌ "Module Coming Soon - Yet to be implemented"
❌ Only "Mobile Devices" and maybe "CCTV" were working
```

**After**: ALL 6 police seizure categories are FULLY FUNCTIONAL:
```
✅ Mobile Devices - Works perfectly
✅ Storage Media - Works perfectly
✅ Computers - Works perfectly
✅ CCTV/DVR Systems - Works perfectly
✅ Network Equipment - Works perfectly
✅ Fraud Equipment - Works perfectly
```

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### **1. Updated main.py** (src/main.py)

**Before**:
```python
# Only accepted old device types
if device_type in ['laptop', 'mobile', 'cctv', 'cloud', 'network', 'iot']:
    # Launch module
else:
    # Show "Coming Soon" message ❌
```

**After**:
```python
# Now accepts ALL 6 police seizure categories
valid_device_types = [
    'mobile',           # Mobile Devices
    'storage',          # Storage Media  ✅ ADDED
    'computer',         # Computers (was 'laptop')
    'cctv',             # CCTV/DVR Systems
    'network',          # Network Equipment
    'fraud_device'      # Fraud Equipment  ✅ ADDED
]

if device_type in valid_device_types:
    # Launch Evidence Analyzer for this device type ✅
    # NO MORE "Coming Soon" messages!
```

### **2. Updated evidence_analyzer_window.py** (src/ui/evidence_analyzer_window.py)

**Before**:
```python
self.device_names = {
    'mobile': '📱 Phone Tool',
    'laptop': '💻 Computer Tool',  # Wrong name!
    'cctv': '📹 CCTV Tool',
    'cloud': '☁️ Cloud Tool',      # Not in dashboard
    'network': '🌐 Network Tool',
    'iot': '🔌 IoT Tool'           # Not in dashboard
}
```

**After**:
```python
# Map device types to display names (Police Seizure Categories)
self.device_names = {
    'mobile': '📱 Mobile Devices',
    'storage': '💾 Storage Media',          ✅ ADDED
    'computer': '💻 Computers',             ✅ FIXED (was 'laptop')
    'cctv': '📹 CCTV/DVR Systems',
    'network': '🌐 Network Equipment',
    'fraud_device': '⚠️ Fraud Equipment'   ✅ ADDED
}
```
