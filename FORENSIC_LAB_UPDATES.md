# Forensic Lab Updates - Real Police Seizure Workflow

## ✅ UI Redesigned for Actual Police Evidence

The Evidence Analyzer has been completely reorganized based on **actual police seizure patterns** - matching what forensic labs receive in real cybercrime and fraud investigations.

---

## 🚔 What Changed

### **Before: Generic Device Categories**
- Mobile Phone
- Laptop/Computer
- CCTV Camera
- Cloud Storage
- Network Traffic
- IoT Devices

**Problem**: Too generic, doesn't match real-world police seizures

### **After: Police Seizure Categories**
1. **📱 Mobile Devices** (99% of cases)
2. **💾 Storage Media** (USB, memory cards, SIM cards)
3. **💻 Computers** (laptops, desktops, hard drives)
4. **📹 CCTV/DVR Systems** (surveillance footage)
5. **🌐 Network Equipment** (routers, modems)
6. **⚠️ Fraud Equipment** (SIM boxes, skimmers, specialized devices)

**Solution**: Matches actual evidence categories police bring to the lab
